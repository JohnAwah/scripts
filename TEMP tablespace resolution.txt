> If there is enough space in temporary tablespace, then check df -h and see if  mount point for tempfs has space.

>If there is space, then check alert log files for any possible errors related to temp file space
>If there is no space in temp tablespace as in check above, consider adding a temp file into the temp tablespace as follows 
to add space into temp tablespace as follows:

SQL> desc dba_temp_files;
SQL> select file_name,TABLESPACE_NAME from dba_temp_files;
add temp file into temp tablespace OR resize existing temp file to add space to temp tablespace.
