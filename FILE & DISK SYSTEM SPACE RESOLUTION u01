RESOLVING FILESYSTEM SPACE ISSUES:

-df -h (To see mount point of diffeent filesystems)

-df -hT /mount point (to check size and percentage usage of mount point)

log into the directory e.g 
-cd /u01 (mount point dierectory)
-du -Sh | sort -rh | head -5 (to get the top 5 files consuming space in the directory in Linux)
-du -sh * | grep T or G (to get top G and T files in directory)

- [oracle@odm6db01 zba01]$ df -h | grep zba
-[oracle@vorarac1d01 ~]$ df -h | grep /dbackup0

-Proceed to check whats inside the file consuming the most space and seek permission to delete to obtain space
-Take screenshot and share solution

-cd to directory consuming high space
.to delete bulk files older than 7 days: $ find . -name "*.aud" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
.rm -rf file name (to delete files on Linux) e.g:

[oracle@vdaloraclep001 trace]$ rm -rf *.trc
[oracle@vdaloraclep001 trace]$ rm -rf *.trm

-Also check if log rotation scripts are enabled:
-check on crontab for purge_crs_trace files
-check for crontab for purge_asm_trace files

> If there is enough space in temporary tablespace, then check df -h and see if  mount point for tempfs has space.

>If there is space, then check alert log files for any possible errors related to temp file space
>If there is no space in temp tablespace as in check above, consider adding a temp file into the temp tablespace as follows 
to add space into temp tablespace as follows:

SQL> desc dba_temp_files;
SQL> select file_name,TABLESPACE_NAME from dba_temp_files;
add temp file into temp tablespace OR resize existing temp file to add space to temp tablespace.

Hi Mallika / Amy

During weekend on call support,  we have come across scenarios where Unix admin support would be required as DBA team doesn’t hold the root access.

1.	/  (root) file system alert last night with 20% threshold breached on odm4db02-adm.kbm1.loc 

2.	/var file system alert with 10% threshold breached on vdaloraclet001.
Logs are owned by root.
 
3.	 Also,  to deploy OEM agents,  we’d need Unix team help for root access.  (can touch-base on  Monday for this )

Pl let us know guidelines to reach to Unix admin team:
i.	Through Workfront ticket and If any specific queue ?
ii.	Through maestro ticket for P1 issues and if any specific queue ? 
iii.	Through Contacting Operation support team to escalate issue where Unix admin team support required and if very critical  and specific queue  or directly by calling?
