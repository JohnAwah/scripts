1. How to get System and Database uptime

At O.S level: uptime
              or top

2.size of RMAN database backup:

select ctime "Date", decode(backup_type, 'L', 'Archive Log', 'D', 'Full', 'Incremental') backup_type,
bsize "Size MB" from (select trunc(bp.completion_time) ctime , backup_type , round(sum(bp.bytes/1024/1024),2) bsize
from v$backup_set bs, v$backup_piece bp where bs.set_stamp = bp.set_stamp and bs.set_count  = bp.set_count
and bp.status = 'A' group by trunc(bp.completion_time), backup_type) order by 1, 2;


3. RUNTIME OF TYPES OF RMAN BACKUPS:

col STATUS format a9
col hrs format 999.99
select
SESSION_KEY, INPUT_TYPE, STATUS,
to_char(START_TIME,'mm/dd/yy hh24:mi') start_time,
to_char(END_TIME,'mm/dd/yy hh24:mi')   end_time,
elapsed_seconds/3600                   hrs
from V$RMAN_BACKUP_JOB_DETAILS
order by session_key;


*Not sure about these stats:

-Under operational summary:

Stats	
Dictionary Stats Schedule 	Every Sunday of week 04:30 AM
Dictionary Stats Runtime	10 Minutes
Schema Stats Schedule 	Every Sunday of week 03:30 AM
Schema Stats Runtime	2hrs 30 minutes
Maintenance	
Housekeeping	Executed


-Last backup location
-Backup retention

4. Location of last rman backup, show parameter recovery;

ramn>list copy; or list backup;


5. show backup retention policy:

RMAN>show retention policy;

6.Obtain information for CPU,memory and disk on OEM.

-Log into OEM using URL in connectivity sheet
 .Username:sysman
  Password: Pr0d3mprd

-click on target to see the different hosts(servers)
-click on server name > click on monitoring> And you will see CPU,memory,and Disk tabs
-first click on CPU details > click CPU utilization > click on view tab on the right and select 'last 31 days' > copy data and graph and put in report
-Do same for memory details(memory utilization > due date last 31 days) and disk details (select max disk i/o> last 31 days). Do this for all servers.



7. For Availability chart:

-Go to OEM > select Target > Click hosts > Monitoring> Status History >Due date (last 31 days) > copy chart and info and fill in the report
.Do same for all the hosts
-Dont change anything under Availability Performance Indicators
-Next part 'SERVICE SUMMARY CHARTS'...will be explained later.
