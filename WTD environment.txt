-STEPS IN RESOLVING WTD TICKETS:

-Acknowledge the ticket on Workfront app, so that client knows one is working on it.
-If its a script, remember we only execute ddl scripts unless otherwise.
-You can also ping on teams the sender of ticket about any input needed or whether the ticket needs any info(for example sequence of executing the script/ticket)
-Always state the ticket number while pinging the sender. You can find ticket number on the Task details tab in WF platform.
-Proceed to download the script from Work front app, by clicking on the script and click download arrow
-Always review the scripts contents, try to understand it before executing( beware of drop, and truncate statements)
-Open the connectivity sheet and look for the the service name, DB name, server name and if the server name comes with ODM you know it is EXADATA server.
-Once the server name has been identified, log into the database using putty
-Login using the Oracle user as above.
-Most of databases are 2 node RAC
.Once you log into the Exadata server, from there you can then ssh into any of the nodes
.You cannot find all of the databases in all the nodes. They will be in one or two nodes
.ps -ef|grep pmon to get correct database
. set environment(. oraenv)

sqlplus

/ as sysdba

.select name from v$database;
.select name from v$active_services; (to confirm the service we are accessing)
-create a .sql file at O.S level and give it the name of the script to be executed(vi ...) 
-within the .sql file( insert 'set echo on' statement at the begining so as to see output of the script)
.copy the script inside the file,save it and exit. 
.Use this query below to confirm database name, service, name etc before running the scriptcol db_name for a15

col db_name for a15
col service for a25
col HOST_NAME for a28
col username for a25
col account_status for a20
select c.name "DB_NAME",a.name "SERVICE",b.HOST_NAME from  v$active_services a , v$instance b, v$database c where UPPER(a.name)='UHGPRD';

- Now run the script, and copy output from database name verified above to end of output of script, create a notepad and give it name of the scipt (_log) and save on desktop to send to client.
-create another .sql file and copy content into it and file starting with 'set echo on' in file.
.You can also create a spool file for the logs to be created into it if procedure is very long.
 e.g sql> spool /tmp/sql_blocker_info.html
          script content
          spool off
-copy content of output , create its own logfile name and save on desktop.
-Go now to Workfront ticket and reply to sender of ticket:( Request has been completed, and we have also uploaded the logfile) and click reply.
-Go now and upload the logfiles. On same Workfront app, click "Add New">Document>select the logfiles and upload.
-You can note it down in your daily tasks summary and the time it took to execute and the details.

-Open connectivity sheet, copy the service name and search for it in the sheet (Control + F and select Workbook, uncheck all matching boxes and click Find next)
-log into the portal and open a session on mobaxterm
.click ssh> put server name, oracle and sign in
.ps -ef|grep pmon to confirm database name as in connectivity sheet
.create the file to be excuted in the server (vi file_name.sql)
.copy content of script and paste into vi file( first type at the top of the file:set echo on, set verify on, set timing on)
.read through the file again to double check
.
.esc, :wq to save
.log into the database.
.set environment by using definition in oratab file ( . oraen, derpd1)
.log into the database(sqlplus)
.sql> show parameter service; (to verify service name)
SQL> alter session set current_schema=ODB; (if schema is not mentioned in the script)
.If its a CDB
do this to see pdbs:

set line 200 pages 200
col CON_NAME for a30
select CON_ID,CON_NAME ,NAME from V$ACTIVE_SERVICES order by 1;

.sql>connect to the pdb : alter session set container=pdb;
.sql> select name from V$ACTIVE_SERVICES where upper(name)='OC_WCC_WMD3CPRD'; (make sure service name is correct)
.!ls -ltr (confirm name of script)
.l (enter)
