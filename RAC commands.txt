RAC COMMANDS:

-To see RAC database unique_name: $srvctl config database
-To see configuration variables for RAC database: $srvctl config database -d UNIQUE_NAME
-You will get variables like: DB unique_name, DB name, Oracle home, Oracle User, spfile, P.W file.
-To check the service name in RAC database: srvctl status service -d DOPRD_NCO
-To check the status of database in RAC:    srvctl status database -d DOPRD_NCO
-To identify processes in database: show parameter processes;
-identify database objects in order to query them : desc dba_objects;

-When databases in RAC hang and all services are not running from (ps -ef|grep pmon) and we are unable to check df -h, we will need to check the top command, free -m command, all OS processes
Then:
1. secondly, log in as grid user and check status of cluster
$ su - grid
Password:
[grid@vdalphonedev01 ~]$ . oraenv
ORACLE_SID = [grid] ? +ASM
The Oracle base has been set to /u01/app/grid
[grid@vdalphonedev01 ~]$ crsctl stat res -t

.If resources are up and running but not indicating or not up and running, start or stop cluster resources as the case may be;


2.Commands to start/stop standalone cluster:
crsctl status has
crsctl check has
crsctl stop has
crsctl start has 

.we use 'has' for RAC standalone
.Also note that for standalone RAC we will see ASM as +ASM

crsctl stat res -t

3. for cluster RAC with morethan one node we will use below commands to troubleshoot RAC services:
crsctl status crs
crsctl start crs
crsctal stop crs
.for multiple node RAC we will see ASM as +ASM1 or 2 etc

-To check last reboot: $last roboot
-To reboot in WTD: Sysadmin will do that.
