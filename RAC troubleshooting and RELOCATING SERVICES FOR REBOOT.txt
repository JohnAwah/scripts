RELOCATING SERVICES FROM ONE RAC DATABASE INSTANCE TO ANOTHER: 2 WAYS:

A. SINGLE COMMAND:

B.

1. Check if and what services are running and on which nodes they are running

[oracle@vdaloraclep002 ~]$ srvctl status service database -d idcprod  (command to see RAC services & idcprod is db_unique_name)
Service oc_wcc_antprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_dmoprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_huiprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_ovt3cprd is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_ovtprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_uhuprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_wmd3cprd is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_wmdprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2

2. Shutdown the instance from which you are trying relocate services: Either by:


a.Bring them down both manually by logging into the database( shutdown immediate)
b.Or by srvctl stop service....(usually a problem).

3.check cluster services is disabled on the relocating node in case multiple reboots is ready which
 should not bring up the instance, do the following:

-log in on the relocating node as grid user
-. oraenv
-+ASM
-crsctl check crs (to check if its enable)
-crsctl stop crs
-crsctl diable crs      (some environments may require this to be done as root, so check if it fails with insufficient privilges)

4. Reboot (now0

5. After reboot is done of the instance is done and all is fine, bring back the cluster service on node 1 as follows:

-crsctl start crs
-crsctl enable crs
-Check if instanse is also up on node 1, if not , start instance on node 1, possibly manually as it was shutdown manually

6.Check services in the cluster again to make sure its running on all instances:

[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ srvctl status service database -d idcprod
Service oc_wcc_antprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_dmoprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_huiprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_ovt3cprd is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_ovtprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_uhuprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_wmd3cprd is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2
Service oc_wcc_wmdprd_idc is running on instance(s) idcprod1,idcprod2

7.check if instances in the cluster are up and running:

[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ srvctl status database -d idcprod
Instance idcprod1 is running on node vdaloraclep001
Instance idcprod2 is running on node vdaloraclep002

-OTHER RAC COMMANDS:

Processes of starting RAC database and commands:

1. Cluster services:
. oraenv 
-crsctl check crs
-crsctl start/stop crs
-crsctl check crs

* Also check if cluster services are running on all nodes:

[grid@vdaloraclep001 bin]$ ./crsctl stat res -t

2.Manage ASM

Check if ASM is up on a given instance:

[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ . oraenv
ORACLE_SID = [oracle] ? idcprod1


-[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ srvctl status asm -n vdaloraclep001
ASM is not running on vdaloraclep001
-Start ASM
[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ srvctl start asm -n vdaloraclep001
[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ srvctl status asm -n vdaloraclep001
ASM is running on vdaloraclep001

3. Manage database instance:

-[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ srvctl status database -d idcprod
Instance idcprod1 is running on node vdaloraclep001
Instance idcprod2 is running on node vdaloraclep002

or start database instances if not started:

-[oracle@vdaloraclep001 ~]$ srvctl start database -d idcprod (database unique_name)


-CHECK ASM ALERT LOG FILE:/u01/app/grid/diag/asm/+asm/+ASM1/trace
-CHECK DATABASE ALERT LOGFILE:
