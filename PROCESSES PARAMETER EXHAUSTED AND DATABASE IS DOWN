DATABASE IS DOWNN DUE TO EXHAUSTION OF PROCESSES:

1.TRY TO SIGN IN AS SYSDBA (connect / as sysdba)
 if this fails
 
2.sqlplus -prelim "/ as sysdba"


-IF ANY OF THE TWO COMMANDS WORK and you are able to sign into the database:

3. > show parameter processes;

4 > show parameter session;

5.set processes value to be thesame as sessions parameter value:

alter system set processes=1200 scope=spfile;


-BUT IN SCENARIO WHERE THE ERROR DOES NOT ALLOW YOU LOG INTO THE DATABASE WITH EITHER OF THE ABOVE MEANS:

FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1 At O.S level do:

ps -ef|grep pmon

-If the database process is running, you will have to do stop the database if it is not production db:

$srvctl status database -d db_name ( to see if database is running)
$srvctl stop database -d db_name (as in grep output)(it will stop the db or say it was already stopped)...then restart
$srvtctl start database -d db_name 

If it starts, do:

sqlplus / as sysdba

and alter processes parameter value by increasing it to session parameter value as below:

> show parameter processes;

> show parameter session;

>set processes value to be thesame as sessions parameter value:

alter system set processes=1200 scope=spfile;
