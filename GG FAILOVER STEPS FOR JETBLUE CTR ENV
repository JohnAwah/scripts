GOLDENGATE FAILOVER STEPS FOR JETBLUE CTR ENVIRONMENT :

 GoldenGate replication setup is for following CTR Environments: 
 
-	Databases: GoldenGate replication is setup for five CTR databases namely:
    Online (DOPRD), Reservations (DRPRD), Fares (DFPRD), Availcache (DAPRD) and Checking (CCPRD). 


-	GoldenGate Software: GoldenGate software is installed and configured for each database in a separate home for respective RDBMS versions. For CCPRD database GoldenGate software version 19.1 is installed for Oracle 12c and for rest of the databases GoldenGate software version 19.1 is installed for Oracle 19c.

3.0 JetBlue Oracle GoldenGate Failover  
 
Oracle GoldenGate replication is always running uni-directional from Active site to Passive site in CTR application. Currently GoldenGate replication is setup from Culpeper databases (Active Site) to Englewood databases (Passive Site)
 
On active site GoldenGate Capture processes are configured to capture transactional data and sequences and send to passive site GoldenGate instances over TCP/IP using GoldenGate pump processes.

On Passive site GoldenGate Apply processes are configured to apply transactions captured in active site. 

For site failover, each GoldenGate processes needs to be shut down in a specific sequence to avoid any data loss in this case replication from CUA to EGW needs to be stopped. Similarly, each process needs to be restarted from EGW to CUA to activate reverse replication in a specific sequence before handing over for application transaction to avoid data loss.

  
4.0 Replication Failover Steps For CTR
 
Cintra recommend following steps for CTR replication failover from active site to passive site.
 
1. Stop GoldenGate Replication on Source (Active Site- CUA)
2. Stop GoldenGate Replication on Target (Passive Site- EGW)
3. Start GoldenGate Reverse Replication on Failover Source Site (New Active Site- EGW)
4. Start GoldenGate Reverse Replication on Failover Target Site (New Passive Site- CUA) 
 
 
 
 
4.1 Stop GoldenGate Replication on Source (Active Site- CUA)
 
Application needs to be shutdown before stopping GoldenGate Processes in Active Site. Once application is shutdown stop all GoldenGate processes running on Active site (CUA) in all 5 databases.

Following are the commands used in DAPRD to stop GoldenGate Processes in synchronous way without any data loss. Same commands with each processes name will be used in other GoldenGate instances

1.	Set profile and login to DAPRD GoldenGate instance

[ggsowner@JBCUALORA1002C ~]$ g

4.	Similarly check downstream PUMP process and stop it using above commands.
 
4.2 Stop GoldenGate Replication on Target (Passive Site- EGW)
 
Once GoldenGate processes are shutdown in Active Site, check replication downstream processes in EGW passive site for any lag or pending transactions, stop these processes when lag is zero and there are no pending transactions.

Following are the commands used in DAPRD to stop GoldenGate Processes in passive site without any data loss. Same commands with each processes name will be used in other GoldenGate instances

1.	Set profile and login to DAPRD GoldenGate instance

4.3 Start GoldenGate Reverse Replication on Failover Source Site (New Active Site- EGW)

After the replication from Active Site to Passive Site is completely stopped, prepare EGW site as new Active Site. This is achieved by starting reverse replication processes and flushing replicated sequences in respective EGW CTR databases Following is an example on DAPRD Database and GoldenGate Instance, similar steps needs to be performed in each database.
 
1.	On each respective CTR EGW database, check which application schema is being replicated and execute below command for it to flush it sequences, so that Extract process can pickup next sequence number when it is changed.

4.4 Start GoldenGate Reverse Replication on Failover Target Site (New Passive Site- CUA)


1.	Compare source and target sequence values. Target sequences should be greater than source sequences. If there is a big difference better them and target sequences are behind source then better to refresh them on target and then execute FLUSH SEQUENCE command on target to get them ahead of source sequences.
2.	Set profile and login to DAPRD GoldenGate instance
