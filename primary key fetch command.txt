-If you knew the table name that you were looking for, you could modify the SQL as follows:

SELECT cols.table_name, cols.column_name, cols.position, cons.status, cons.owner
FROM all_constraints cons, all_cons_columns cols
WHERE cols.table_name = 'TABLE_NAME'
AND cons.constraint_type = 'P'
AND cons.constraint_name = cols.constraint_name
AND cons.owner = cols.owner
ORDER BY cols.table_name, cols.position;
Make sure to type the table_name in uppercase, as Oracle stores all table names in uppercase.

Let's quickly explain the output from this query.

table_name
The name of the table (stored in uppercase).
column_name
The name of the column that is a part of the primary key. (also stored in uppercase)
position
The position in the primary key. A primary key can contain more than one column, so understanding the order of the columns in the primary key is very important.
status
Indicates whether the primary key is currently enabled or disabled.
owner
Indicates the schema that owns the table.
