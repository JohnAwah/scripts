STEPS to Deploy CTR R16.0.5 to EGW PROD (09/27/2021)

1. STOP DOPRD GG Pump process in CUA CTR PROD

-Log into JBCUALORA1002C server on putty as the root user(PW:BlueSkies2019)
- su - ggsowner 
- . .profile_doprd19c
-$ g (hit enter and it signs you into the ggsci) (confirm it is GG for 19c database)

exit back as ggsowner and
- ps -ef | grep mgr ( To see the Manager process parameter files)
- . .profile_drprd19c
-$ g (hit enter to log into the ggsci)
-ggsci> info mgr (check if Manager is running)
-ggsci> info all (To see if all processes...Mgr, Extract (prefix E_O_NVA), Pump ( Prefix P_DO_) are running)

-exit
-$ . .profile_doprd19c
-$ g
-$ ggsci> info all (to see that all processes are running)
-$ ggsci> stop P_DO_NCO
-$ ggsci> info all to see that pump has stopped	
	
2. Check replication is in SYNC in EGW CTR all 5 databases

-log into JBEGWLORA1002C server on putty as the root user (PW:BlueSkies2019)
-ps -ef |grep mgr (to see the different databases)
-su - ggssowner
-ggsowner $ . .profile_doprd19c
-ggsowner $ g 
-ggsci > info all (since it is the target server...See Mgr, Replicat1 and Replicat2 running)
-ggsci > info R* ( To see status of the Replicats)
	
		
3. Stop replication in all 5 databases in EGW:

-ggsci JBEGWLORA1002C> info R*
-ggsci JBEGWLORA1002C> stop R*
	
		
4. Create Restore point in all 5 databases in EGW

-connect  to another JBEGWLORA1002C terminal on putty as root
-su - oracle
- . .profile_doprd
- sqlplus / as sysdba
> show parameter name ( to see if parameters of the database)
> select name from v$restore_point;
> create restore point EGW_R1605_before_deploy guarantee flashback database;
> select name from v$restore_point:

-Go into drprd19c on terminal 2 in step 2, and...
-log into JBEGWLORA1002C server
-ggsowner JBEGWLORA1002C $ . .profile_drprd19c (disaster recovery server)
-ggsowner JBEGWLORA1002C $ g
-ggsowner JBEGWLORA1002C $ info R* (Replicat running)
-ggsowner JBEGWLORA1002C $ stop R*

- Go back now to create restore point terminal
-set . .profile_drprd
-sqlplus / as sysdba
-select name from v$restore_restore point;( to see restore points that exist in the DB)
-create restore point EGW_R1605_before_deploy guarantee flashback database; (Confirm that replicat stopped on drprd19c first)
-select name from v$restore_point: (to see restore points in the database)
-drop restore_point; (dropping irrelevant restore_points leaving only the one required to flashback the database after the deployment)


	
		
5. Unlock DLX accounts in all 5 databases in EGW:

-Unlock DLX accounts in all 5 databases.
	
	
	
6. handover for test



1.stop GG
2.take restore points
3.unlock DLEX* schemas
-SQL> select username from dba_users;
-SQL> desc dba_users;
-SQL> select username, ACCOUNT_STATUS from dba_users where username=upper('DLEX_B6RESV');
-SQL> alter user msaimadanmohan account unlock;

4.validate
5.upgrade
6.take another restore points


Once deployment is completed, we usually flashback all databases to 1st restore points taken.

This is for EGW.

After flashback is completed, only then we restart stopped GG processes.
