-Update reservation database and add two new indexes within RRESV_AIR_LEG_SALE table. These are needed for performance improvements as well as future capabilities

-Cintra to create both indexes in advance of the go-live with no ill effects. Then when running the DB upgrade with the usual option (./upgrade.ksh)  , when the time come to run upgrade for R16.1 it would be discovered that the indexes already exists and therefore no DDL will be required. 

If possible we’d like to run this upgrade on a copy of production – to verify abd give some idea of the timings.


-to check size of table: 

SQL> select segment_name,sum(bytes)/(1024*1024)"TABLE_SIZE(MB)" from dba_extents where segment_type='TABLE' and owner=upper('DLEX_B6REPORT') and segment_name=upper('RRESV_AIR_LEG_SALE') group by segment_name;

SEGMENT_NAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TABLE_SIZE(MB)
--------------
RRESV_AIR_LEG_SALE
           296

-To get name of table owner:

select owner, object_type from dba_objects where object_name='RRESV_AIR_LEG_SALE' and object type='TABLE';
